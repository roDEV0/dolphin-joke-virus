# dolphin-joke-virus
Joke Virus made by me that redirects to a certain YouTube video whenever a new tab is opened or a URL is updated.

HOW TO ADD TO YOUR BROWSER:
1. Extract the Zip File in an easy to access directory
2. Go to chrome://extensions in Google Chrome
3. Toggle developer mode on your account (Note there are some security risks with doing this)
4. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the folder

THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE VIRUS IS TO REMOVE IT FROM YOUR EXTENSIONS:
1. Click on the puzzle piece icon to the right of your url bar
2. Scroll down until you see the "Dolphin Curse" extension and click the 3 dots
3. Click "Remove from Chrome"
